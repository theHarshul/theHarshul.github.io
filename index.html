<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Me</h3>

<p>My name is Harshul Mulchandani and I am going into my Senior Year at the University of Southern California as a Computer Science &amp; Business Administration Major. I am passionate about building products that have a major impact. Most recently, I worked at Expedia as a Software Development Engineer Intern where I worked with React Native, an exciting cross-platform development framework.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tandemparking.co/"><strong>Tandem Parking</strong></a><img src="images/tandem_icon.png" width="150" height="150" align="left" />
Funded by the USC Startup Incubator, we are the Airbnb of Parking. We are seeking to solve parking scarcity in LA through pairing drivers looking for parking with lenders who have unused parking spots. I am leading the Engineering Team and building the Android App. Some cool &amp; useful technologies we have used include RxJava, Retrofit, Google Maps/Location, and Google SmartLock.</p>



<p><a href="https://github.com/theHarshul/Plug"><strong>Plug</strong></a><img src="images/plug_icon.png" width="150" height="150" align="left" style="background-color:black" />
Inspired by my time at Sonos, I wanted to create an app that creates truly personal custom playlists. Music streaming services like Spotify, Apple Music, and etc. require you to follow a bunch of artists in order to understand your music taste. I attempted to streamline this process by analyzing metadata from your most personal source of music, the music library.</p>
